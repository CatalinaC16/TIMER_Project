I programmed in VHDL(Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) a very useful
project for complex systems. I also did an implementation on FPGA, more specific on Basys3. The Timer has
a count up by default, when the START button is on, a counter down, incrementation or hold when the Minutes/Seconds buttons are on/off. 
The project contains some mini-projects like: anode activation (cathods also), debouncers, counters, bcd to 7 segm. for the display, frequency dividers etc.
